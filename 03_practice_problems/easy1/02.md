1. != means "not equal to", and is used in conditional statements.

2. !user_name means "not user_name", or evaluates to false, since user_name is a truthy value.

3. words.uniq! means the uniq method will mutate the caller (words). ! after methods tends to denote that they are mutating.

4. In the ternary operator, the question mark comes before the expression that is evaluated if the statement is false.

5. ? after something is used in methods that check for a specific conditions (includes? check if an object includes a value, start_with? checks if an object starts with a specific value, etc.) Basically, it's syntax to denote the method does a certain action.

6. !!user_name converts truthy/falsey values into strict Boolean data types. (Basically not-not-true, which is true). The first ! turns user_name into a negative boolean, then the second ! flips the negative boolean into a true.
