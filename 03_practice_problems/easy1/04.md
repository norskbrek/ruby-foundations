numbers.delete_at(1) deletes the number at array index 1, then returns that number (in this case, => 2).

numbers.delete(1) deletes the number 1 from the array, then returns that number (in this case, => 1).

#delete_at removes @ the specified index,
#delete removes the specified object.

Both of these methods mutate the array.
