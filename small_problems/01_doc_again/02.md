The first one puts '-4712-01-01', which is "time zero" in the Julian calendar (4713 BCE).

The second one puts '2016-01-01', as the argument passed defined the year, and Ruby gave that year the generic month and day of 01-01.

The third one puts '2016-05-01', since two arguments (year, month) were passed into the method.

The fourth one puts '2016-05-13', since we've passed in three parameters (year, month, day).
