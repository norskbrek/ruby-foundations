It'll print out:

BOB
BOB

On line 1, name is assigned to the value 'Bob'.
On line 2, save_name is assigned to the value of name.
(At this point, they have save value and object ID).
On line 3, name is mutated by #upcase!
This method mutates the caller, but the object ID remains
the same. It also mutates save_name, because it and name
point to the same string object. 
Thus, on line 4, we are putting the same string object twice,
it just happens to have two variable names pointing at it.
